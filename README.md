# Revenge
Java Game
Hi,
If you are not familiar with Github you can check out the tutorials.
Just to reiterate, the game concept is about bad things drivers do (cutting you off,cell phone use, etc...),we should make a list of those issues, and the responses that we can do (Weapons!).  I would normally use an application like Project to manage a project,
however I don't believe everyone would have access to this and it's also probably not even necessary with a small project.  So I've created an Excell To-Do sheet instead to help us keep on track.  Please check it and make any changes that y'all see fit.  Initially, we just need to make sure that all the tasks are there and decompose the larger ones into smaller chuncks when appropriate. Then we can just choose what we want and annotate in the comments section (with your name) so we don't duplicate any efforts.   Obviously, communication is vital for the sucess of any project.  We need to help each other out when we run into walls and understand that no question is too stupid to ask each other about.  I set the project for one month as you will see by the dates.  When a task is completed, we should use the dropdown in the sheet to mark it as "Yes".  Of course, all sugestions and recomendations are welcome.
Let me know what you think,
Edwin
