# Readme for GameSaveTest

**First, you need the csv file in the folder of java files or change the path.**

These folder consist of 2 java files and one csv file. The class CSV contains simple read and write methods for handling csv files. The other class 'SaveGame' extends CSV and handles reading and writing to 'saveGame.csv' file, this class will grow more as more columns are added, or it could completely change if another formatting is more better for saving game data.

###### Things Done

- Ability to get all scores, names, level (will change according to the game)
